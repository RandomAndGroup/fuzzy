        Hmm? Yeah, I heard my children got shot…Tch..
        I always knew it was a bad idea to leave the kids with her… 
        she can’t even take care of them properly! Look at what she got the kids into! 
        <br>Sly woman…I divorced her because I had doubts about our third child Danny…
        I'm sure she had an affair! The dates just don't match up….
        I am done with her nonsense…
        <br><p>And you know what's even crazier? She tried to go on a date with another man right after our divorce!  
            What was that guy's name again? Uh..Simson? Hmph, even his wife left him… 
            apparently Diane and Simson were hanging out way too much and his wife started to have suspicions..
            serve them right! I would have taken the kids instead but..
            you know, 3 is a bit too much and I'm not even sure if one of them is even mine!</p>
