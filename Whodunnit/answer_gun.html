        Oh…The gun? A gun? I don't know how I would know what happened to the gun, aren't you the officer?!
         <br>I don’t even have a gun dammit! Wait… Diane?? 
         <br>Oh yeah, she did buy a gun…back in Arizona where her secret lover lived! 
         <br> I don't know what happened to it though…
