        Still To-Do:
        <br>
         First, get to the scene safely. Next, document everything you observe upon
        arrival. Check on the location and condition of the victim. Observe whether any persons
        or vehicles are leaving the area, and determine the identity of all persons present. Take
        note of the weather conditions, the lighting conditions, the time you arrived, etc. Use all
        your powers of observation, and document everything. Note also what is present at the
        scene that should not be there, and also what should be at the scene but is absent...
