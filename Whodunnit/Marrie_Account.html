        I- I don't know how it all happened! 
        <br><p>At one moment a carjacker was trying to get me out of the car and so I refused and threatened to call the police....
            and the next moment, the man had a gun to our car window! 
            I started driving immediately to try and get her out in one piece but the bullets still hit us….
            I- I got shot in the arm but I kept on driving...but Silvia...
            Oh, poor Silvia! My heart broke in so many pieces...( Sobs and cries) 
            Tony didn't even pick the phone when I tried to phone him…So I called my 
            coworker Robert…The moment the man shot us I immediately started driving to save 
            my child...…..
            oh I don't know what to do!!! ( breaks down)</p>
