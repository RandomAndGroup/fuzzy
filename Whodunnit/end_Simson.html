        <br> Robert Knickerbocker was never a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He was questioned, yes, 
        <br>but the police never had a reason to doubt him. After the shooting, 
        <br>Robert even came clean to his wife about the affair, 
        <br>and then, went on to help the police in their investigation.
