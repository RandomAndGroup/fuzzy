    <h1><header>Detective POV:</header></h1>
<body>Ah, welcome young one...
    <br>        
    Today you will be taking the role of John Watson, the sidekick of the very famous detective sherlock! 
Sherlock is very famous, isn't he? But recently he has to run some...errands..(or who knows what he's  up to now?) 
Sigh...who am I? I am the game master! Obvi (rolls eyes) Oh and before we get into it I'd like to let you know...if you don't solve the crime...you don't get to return home! ;)
Anyway, as I said the poor guy got roped into it, and now it's your job to help him conduct the investigation!</body>
